I"÷<p>For this project Iâ€™m actually revisiting this particular topic. The original version of this project was done at a feverish pitch due to time constraints, so I wanted to come back and use the experience as an opportunity to tidy up my approach and learn a new web scraping framework, Scrapy. Some aspects of the tools and methodology might seem like using a bazooka to swat a fly, but on that day when you need a bazooka, you wanted it pointed at the advancing zombie hordes and not your face!</p>

I"­<p>Hello! I am a Data Scientist with a background in video game production and development. Iâ€™m mostly analytical, but I have a strong creative streak. I like to solve problems, think deeply, learn new things and make beautiful, compelling  presentations. In my previous life I was in video game product development at both Sony and Microsoft which gave me great experience leading cross-functional teams and presenting to stakeholders, as well as strong technical and managerial skills. At the end of the day though I love making cool things cooler.</p>
